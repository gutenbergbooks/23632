      'WAY DOWN IN LONESOME COVE
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By Charles Egbert Craddock <br /><br /> 1895
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One memorable night in Lonesome Cove the ranger of the county entered upon
      a momentous crisis in his life. What hour it was he could hardly have
      said, for the primitive household reckoned time by the sun when it shone,
      by the domestic routine when no better might be. It was late. The old
      crone in the chimney-corner nodded over her knitting. In the trundle-bed
      at the farther end of the shadowy room were transverse billows under the
      quilts, which intimated that the small children were numerous enough for
      the necessity of sleeping crosswise. He had smoked out many pipes, and at
      last knocked the cinder from the bowl. The great hickory logs had burned
      asunder and fallen from the stones that served as andirons. He began to
      slowly cover the embers with ashes, that the fire might keep till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, a faded woman, grown early old, was bringing the stone jar of
      yeast to place close by the hearth, that it might not &ldquo;take a chill&rdquo; in
      some sudden change of the night. It was heavy, and she bent in carrying
      it. Awkward, and perhaps nervous, she brought it sharply against the
      shovel in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clash roused the old crone in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recognized the situation instantly, and the features that sleep had
      relaxed into inexpressiveness took on a weary apprehension, which they
      wore like a habit. The man barely raised his surly black eyes, but his
      wife drew back humbly with a mutter of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the shovel was almost thrust out of his grasp. A tiny
      barefooted girl, in a straight unbleached cotten night-gown and a quaint
      little cotton night-cap, cavalierly pushed him aside, that she might cover
      in the hot ashes a burly sweet-potato, destined to slowly roast by
      morning. A long and careful job she made of it, and unconcernedly kept him
      waiting while she pottered back and forth about the hearth. She looked up
      once with an authoritative eye, and he hastily helped to adjust the potato
      with the end of the shovel. And then he glanced at her, incongruously
      enough, as if waiting for her autocratic nod of approval. She gravely
      accorded it, and pattered nimbly across the puncheon floor to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he drawled, in gruff accents, &ldquo;ef you-uns hev all had yer fill o'
      foolin' with this hyar fire, I'll kiver it, like I hev started out ter
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a loud trampling upon the porch without. The
      batten door shook violently. The ranger sprang up. As he frowned the hair
      on his scalp, drawn forward, seemed to rise like bristles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad-burn that thar fresky filly!&rdquo; he cried, angrily. &ldquo;Jes' brung her
      noisy bones up on that thar porch agin, an' her huffs will bust spang
      through the planks o' the floor the fust thing ye know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The narrow aperture, as he held the door ajar, showed outlined against the
      darkness the graceful head of a young mare, and once more hoof-beats
      resounded on the rotten planks of the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clouds were adrift in the sky. No star gleamed in the wide space high
      above the sombre mountains. On every side they encompassed Lonesome Cove,
      which seemed to have importunately thrust itself into the darkling
      solemnities of their intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the ranger let the door fly from his hand, and stood gazing in
      blank amazement. For there was a strange motion in the void vastnesses of
      the wilderness. They were creeping into view. How, he could not say, but
      the summit of the great mountain opposite was marvellously distinct
      against the sky. He saw the naked, gaunt, December woods. He saw the grim,
      gray crags. And yet Lonesome Cove below and the spurs on the other side
      were all benighted. A pale, flickering light was dawning in the clouds; it
      brightened, faded, glowed again, and their sad, gray folds assumed a vivid
      vermilion reflection, for there was a fire in the forest below. Only these
      reactions of color on the clouds betokened its presence and its progress.
      Sometimes a fluctuation of orange crossed them, then a glancing line of
      blue, and once more that living red hue which only a pulsating flame can
      bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air it the comin' o' the Jedgmint Day, Tobe?&rdquo; asked his wife, in a meek
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be afraid so if I war ez big a sinner ez you-uns,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woods air afire,&rdquo; the old woman declared, in a shrill voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They be a-soakin' with las' night's rain,&rdquo; he retorted, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mare was standing near the porch. Suddenly he mounted her and rode
      hastily off, without a word of his intention to the staring women in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left freedom of speech behind him. &ldquo;Take yer bones along, then, ye
      tongue-tied catamount!&rdquo; his wife's mother apostrophized him, with all the
      acrimony of long repression. &ldquo;Got no mo' politeness 'n a settin' hen,&rdquo; she
      muttered, as she turned back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman lingered wistfully. &ldquo;I wisht he wouldn't go a-ridin' off
      that thar way 'thout lettin' we-uns know whar he air bound fur, an' when
      he'll kern back. He mought git hurt some ways roun' that thar fire&mdash;git
      overtook by it, mebbe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef he war roasted 'twould be mighty peaceful round in Lonesome,&rdquo; the old
      crone exclaimed, rancorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter stood for a moment with the bar of the door in her hand,
      still gazing out at the flare in the sky. The unwonted emotion had
      conjured a change in the stereotyped patience in her face&mdash;even
      anxiety, even the acuteness of fear, seemed a less pathetic expression
      than that meek monotony bespeaking a broken spirit. As she lifted her eyes
      to the mountain one might wonder to see that they were so blue. In the
      many haggard lines drawn upon her face the effect of the straight
      lineaments was lost; but just now, embellished with a flush, she looked
      young&mdash;as young as her years.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she buttoned the door and put up the bar her mother's attention was
      caught by the change. Peering at her critically, and shading her eyes with
      her hand from the uncertain flicker of the tallow dip, she broke out,
      passionately: &ldquo;Wa'al, 'Genie, who would ever hev thought ez yer cake would
      be <i>all</i> dough? Sech a laffin', plump, spry gal ez ye useter be&mdash;fur
      all the wort' like a fresky young deer! An' sech a pack o' men ez ye hed
      the choice amongst! An' ter pick out Tobe Gryce an' marry him, an' kem
      'way down hyar ter live along o' him in Lonesome Cove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She chuckled aloud, not that she relished her mirth, but the harlequinade
      of fate constrained a laugh for its antics. The words recalled the past to
      Eugenia; it rose visibly before her. She had had scant leisure to reflect
      that her life might have been ordered differently. In her widening eyes
      were new depths, a vague terror, a wild speculation, all struck aghast by
      its own temerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye never said nuthin ter hender,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knowed Tobe, sca'cely. How's enny-body goin' ter know a man ez
      lived 'way off down hyar in Lonesome Cove?&rdquo; her mother retorted, acridly,
      on the defensive. &ldquo;He never courted <i>me</i>, nohows. All the word he gin
      me war, 'Howdy,' an' I gin him no less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia knelt on the hearth. She placed together the broken chunks, and
      fanned the flames with a turkey wing. &ldquo;I won't kiver the fire yit,&rdquo; she
      said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;He mought be chilled when he gits home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feathery flakes of the ashes flew; they caught here and there in her
      brown hair. The blaze flared up, and flickered over her flushed, pensive
      face, and glowed in her large and brilliant eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobe said 'Howdy,'&rdquo; her mother bickered on. &ldquo;I knowed by that ez he hed
      the gift o' speech, but he spent no mo' words on me.&rdquo; Then, suddenly, with
      a change of tone: &ldquo;I war a fool, though, ter gin my cornsent ter yer
      marryin' him, bein' ez ye war the only child I hed, an' I knowed I'd hev
      ter live with ye 'way down hyar in Lonesome Cove. I wish now ez ye hed
      abided by yer fust choice, an' married Luke Todd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia looked up with a gathering frown. &ldquo;I hev no call ter spen' words
      'bout Luke Todd,&rdquo; she said, with dignity, &ldquo;ez me an' him are both married
      ter other folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said ye hed,&rdquo; hastily replied the old woman, rebuked and
      embarrassed. Presently, however, her vagrant speculation went recklessly
      on. &ldquo;Though ez ter Luke's marryin', 'tain't wuth while ter set store on
      sech. The gal he found over thar in Big Fox Valley favors ye ez close ez
      two black-eyed peas. That's why he married her. She looks precisely like
      ye useter look. An' she laffs the same. An' I reckon <i>she</i> 'ain't hed
      no call ter quit laffin', 'kase he air a powerful easy-goin' man.
      Leastways, he useter be when we-uns knowed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't no sign,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;A saafter-spoken body I never seen
      than Tobe war when he fust kem a-courtin' round the settlemint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sech ez that ain't goin' ter las' noways,&rdquo; dryly remarked the philosopher
      of the chimney-corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might seem rather a reflection upon the courting gentry in general
      than a personal observation. But Eugenia's consciousness lent it point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws-a-massy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Tobe ain't so rampa-gious, nohows, ez folks
      make him out. He air toler'ble peaceable, cornsiderin' ez nobody hev ever
      hed grit enough ter make a stand agin him, 'thout 'twar the Cunnel thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced around at the little girl's face framed in the frill of her
      night-cap, and peaceful and infantile as it lay on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenst the Cunnel war born,&rdquo; Eugenia went on, languidly reminiscent,
      &ldquo;Tobe war powerful outed 'kase she war a gal. I reckon ye 'members ez how
      he said he hed no use for sech cattle ez that. An' when she tuk sick he
      'lowed he seen no differ. 'Jes ez well die ez live,' he said. An' bein'
      ailin', the Cunnel tuk it inter her head ter holler. Sech holler-in'
      we-uns hed never hearn with none o' the t'other chil'ren. The boys war
      nowhar. But a-fust it never 'sturbed Tobe. He jes spoke out same ez he
      useter do at the t'others, 'Shet up, ye pop-eyed buzzard!' Wa'al, sir, the
      Cunnel jes blinked at him, an' braced herself ez stiff, an' <i>yelled!</i>
      I 'lowed 'twould take off the roof. An' Tobe said he'd wring her neck ef
      she warn't so mewlin'-lookin' an' peaked. An' he tuk her up an' walked
      across the floor with her, an' she shet up; an' he walked back agin, an'
      she stayed shet up. Ef he sot down fur a mi nit, she yelled so ez ye'd
      think ye'd be deef fur life, an' ye 'most hoped ye would be. So Tobe war
      obleeged ter tote her agin ter git shet o' the noise. He got started on
      that thar 'forced march,' ez he calls it, an' he never could git off'n it.
      Trot he must when the Cunnel pleased. He 'lowed she reminded him o' that
      thar old Cunnel that he sarved under in the wars. Ef it killed the
      regiment, he got thar on time. Sence then the Cunnel jes gins Tobe her
      orders, an' he moseys ter do 'em quick, jes like he war obleeged ter obey.
      I b'lieve he air, somehows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, some day,&rdquo; said the disaffected old woman, assuming a port of
      prophetic wisdom, &ldquo;Tobe will find a differ. Thar ain't no man so headin'
      ez don't git treated with perslimness by somebody some time. I knowed a
      man wunst ez owned fower horses an' cattle-critters quarryspondin', an' he
      couldn't prove ez he war too old ter be summonsed ter work on the road,
      an' war fined by the overseer 'cordin' ter law. Tobe will git his wheel
      scotched yit, sure ez ye air born. Somebody besides the Cunnel will skeer
      up grit enough ter make a stand agin him. I dunno how other men kin sleep
      o' night, knowin' how he be always darin' folks ter differ with him, an'
      how brigaty he be. The Bible 'pears ter me ter hev Tobe in special mind
      when it gits, ter mournin' 'bout'n the stiff-necked ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The spirited young mare that the ranger rode strove to assert herself
      against him now and then, as she went at a breakneck speed along the sandy
      bridle-path through the woods. How was she to know that the white-wanded
      young willow by the way-side was not some spiritual manifestation as it
      suddenly materialized in a broken beam from a rift in the clouds? But as
      she reared and plunged she felt his heavy hand and his heavy heel, and so
      forward again at a steady pace. The forests served to screen the strange
      light in the sky, and the lonely road was dark, save where the moonbeam
      was splintered and the mists loitered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there were cinders flying in the breeze, a smell of smoke
      pervaded the air, and the ranger forgot to curse the mare when she
      stumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;what them no 'count half-livers o' town folks
      hev hed the shiftlessness ter let ketch afire thar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he neared the brink of the mountain he saw a dense column of smoke
      against the sky, and a break in the woods showed the little town&mdash;the
      few log houses, the &ldquo;gyarden spots&rdquo; about them, and in the centre of the
      Square a great mass of coals, a flame flickering here and there, and two
      gaunt and tottering chimneys where once the court-house had stood. At some
      distance&mdash;for the heat was still intense&mdash;were grouped the
      slouching, spiritless figures of the mountaineers. On the porches of the
      houses, plainly visible in the unwonted red glow, were knots of women and
      children&mdash;ever and anon a brat in the scantiest of raiment ran nimbly
      in and out. The clouds still borrowed the light from below, and the
      solemn, leafless woods on one side were outlined distinctly against the
      reflection in the sky. The flare showed, too, the abrupt precipice on the
      other side, the abysmal gloom of the valley, the austere summit-line of
      the mountain beyond, and gave the dark mysteries of the night a sombre
      revelation, as in visible blackness it filled the illimitable space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little mare was badly blown as the ranger sprang to the ground. He
      himself was panting with amazement and eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stray-book!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Whar's the stray-book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One by one the slow group turned, all looking at him with a peering
      expression as he loomed distorted through the shimmer of the heat above
      the bed of live coals and the hovering smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar's the stray-book?&rdquo; he reiterated, imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar's the court-house, I reckon ye mean to say,&rdquo; replied the sheriff&mdash;a
      burly mountaineer in brown jeans and high boots, on which the spurs
      jingled; for in his excitement he had put them on as mechanically as his
      clothes, as if they were an essential part of his attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, I <i>ain't</i> meanin' ter say whar's the courthouse,&rdquo; said the
      ranger, coming up close, with the red glow of the fire on his face, and
      his eyes flashing under the broad brim of his wool hat. He had a
      threatening aspect, and his elongated shadow, following him and repeating
      the menace of his attitude, seemed to back him up. &ldquo;Ye air sech a
      triflin', slack-twisted tribe hyar in town, ez ennybody would know ef a
      spark cotched fire ter suthin, ye'd set an' suck yer paws, an' eye it till
      it bodaciously burnt up the court-house&mdash;sech a dad-burned lazy set
      o' half-livers ye be! I never axed 'bout'n the court-house. I want ter
      know whar's that thar stray-book,&rdquo; he concluded, inconsequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobe Gryce, ye air fairly demented,&rdquo; exclaimed the register&mdash;a
      chin-whiskered, grizzled old fellow, sitting on a stump and hugging his
      knee with a desolate, bereaved look&mdash;&ldquo;talkin' 'bout the <i>stray-book</i>,
      an' all the records gone! What will folks do 'bout thar deeds, an'
      mortgages, an' sech? An' that thar keerful index ez I had made&mdash;ez
      straight ez a string&mdash;all cinders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, mourning alike for the party of the first part and the
      party of the second part, and the vestiges of all that they had agreed
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' ye ter kem mopin' hyar this time o' night arter the <i>stray-book!</i>&rdquo;
       said the sheriff. &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; And he turned aside and spat disdainfully on
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want that thar stray-book!&rdquo; cried Gryce, indignantly. &ldquo;Ain't nobody
      seen it?&rdquo; Then realizing the futility of the question, he yielded to a
      fresh burst of anger, and turned upon the bereaved register. &ldquo;An' did ye
      jes set thar an' say, 'Good Mister Fire, don't burn the records; what 'll
      folks do 'bout thar deeds an' sech?' an' hold them claws o' yourn, an' see
      the court-house burn up, with that thar stray-book in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half a dozen men spoke up. &ldquo;The fire tuk inside, an' the court-house war
      haffen gone 'fore 'twar seen,&rdquo; said one, in sulky extenuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Tobe be&mdash;let him jaw!&rdquo; said another, cavalierly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobe 'pears ter be sp'ilin' fur a fight,&rdquo; said a third, impersonally, as
      if to direct the attention of any belligerent in the group to the
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The register had an expression of slow cunning as he cast a glance up at
      the overbearing ranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ailed the stray-book ter bide hyar in the court-house all night,
      Tobe? Couldn't ye gin it house-room? Thar warn't no special need fur it to
      be hyar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tobe Gryce's face showed that for once he was at a loss. He glowered down
      at the register and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ez ter me,&rdquo; resumed that worthy, &ldquo;by the law o' the land my books war
      obligated ter be thar.&rdquo; He quoted, mournfully, &ldquo;'Shall at all times be and
      remain in his office.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gathered up his knee again and subsided into silence.

      All the freakish spirits of the air were a-loose in the wind. In fitful
      gusts they rushed up the gorge, then suddenly the boughs would fall still
      again, and one could hear the eerie rout a-rioting far off down the
      valley. Now and then the glow of the fire would deepen, the coals tremble,
      and with a gleaming, fibrous swirl, like a garment of flames, a sudden
      animation would sweep over it, as if an apparition had passed, leaving a
      line of flying sparks to mark its trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' home,&rdquo; drawled Tobe Gryce, presently. &ldquo;I don't keer a frog's
      toe-nail ef the whole settle-mint burns bodaciously up; 'tain't nuthin ter
      me. I hev never hankered ter live in towns an' git tuk up with town ways,
      an' set an' view the court-house like the apple o' my eye. We-uns don't
      ketch fire down in the Cove, though mebbe we ain't so peart ez folks ez
      herd tergether like sheep an' sech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footfalls of the little black mare annotated the silence of the place
      as he rode away into the darkling woods. The groups gradually disappeared
      from the porches. The few voices that sounded at long intervals were low
      and drowsy. The red fire smouldered in the centre of the place, and
      sometimes about it appeared so doubtful a shadow that it could hardly
      argue substance. Far away a dog barked, and then all was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the great mountains loom aggressively along the horizon. The
      black abysses, the valleys and coves, show dun-colored verges and grow
      gradually distinct, and on the slopes the ash and the pine and the oak are
      all lustrous with a silver rime. The mists are rising, the wind springs up
      anew, the clouds set sail, and a beam slants high.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want ter know,&rdquo; said a mountaineer newly arrived on the scene,
      sitting on the verge of the precipice, and dangling his long legs over the
      depths beneath, &ldquo;air how do folks ez live 'way down in Lonesome Cove, an'
      who nobody knowed nuthin about noways, ever git 'lected ranger o' the
      county, ennyhow. I ain't s'prised none ter hear 'bout Tobe Gryce's
      goin's-on hyar las' night. I hev looked fur more'n that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, I'll tell ye,&rdquo; replied the register. &ldquo;Nuthin' but favoritism in
      the county court. Ranger air 'lected by the jestices. Ye know,&rdquo; he added,
      vainglorious of his own tenure of office by the acclaiming voice of the
      sovereign people, &ldquo;ranger ain't 'lected, like the register, by pop'lar
      vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slow smoke still wreathed upward from the charred ruins of the
      court-house. Gossiping groups stood here and there, mostly the jeans-clad
      mountaineers, but there were a few who wore &ldquo;store clothes,&rdquo; being lawyers
      from more sophisticated regions of the circuit. Court had been in session
      the previous day. The jury, serving in a criminal case&mdash;still
      strictly segregated, and in charge of an officer&mdash;were walking about
      wearily in double file, waiting with what patience they might their formal
      discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriffs dog, a great yellow cur, trotted in the rear. When the
      officer was first elected, this animal, observing the change in his
      master's habits, deduced his own conclusions. He seemed to think the
      court-house belonged to the sheriff, and thenceforward guarded the door
      with snaps and growls; being a formidable brute, his idiosyncrasies
      invested the getting into and getting out of law with abnormal
      difficulties. Now, as he followed the disconsolate jury, he bore the
      vigilant mien with which he formerly drove up the cows, and if a juror
      loitered or stepped aside from the path, the dog made a slow detour as if
      to round him in, and the melancholy cortege wandered on as before. More
      than one looked wistfully at the group on the crag, for it was
      distinguished by that sprightly interest which scandal excites so readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ter my way of thinking&rdquo; drawled Sam Peters, swinging his feet over the
      giddy depths of the valley, &ldquo;Tobe ain't sech ez oughter be set over the
      county ez a ranger, noways. 'Pears not ter me, an' I hev been keepin' my
      eye on him mighty sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shadow fell among the group, and a man sat down on a bowlder hard by.
      He, too, had just arrived, being lured to the town by the news of the
      fire. His slide had been left at the verge of the clearing, and one of the
      oxen had already lain down; the other, although hampered by the yoke thus
      diagonally displaced, stood meditatively gazing at the distant blue
      mountains. Their master nodded a slow, grave salutation to the group,
      produced a plug of tobacco, gnawed a fragment from it, and restored it to
      his pocket. He had a pensive face, with an expression which in a man of
      wider culture we should discriminate as denoting sensibility. He had long
      yellow hair that hung down to his shoulders, and a tangled yellow beard.
      There was something at once wistful and searching in his gray eyes, dull
      enough, too, at times. He lifted them heavily, and they had a drooping lid
      and lash. There seemed an odd incongruity between this sensitive, weary
      face and his stalwart physique. He was tall and well proportioned. A
      leather belt girded his brown jeans coat. His great cowhide boots, were
      drawn to the knee over his trousers. His pose, as he leaned on the rock,
      had a muscular picturesque-ness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who be ye a-talkin' about?&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peters relished his opportunity. He laughed in a distorted fashion, his
      pipe-stem held between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You-uns</i> ain't wantin' ter swop lies 'bout sech ez him, Luke! We
      war a-talkin' 'bout Tobe Gryce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The color flared into the new-comer's face. A sudden animation fired his
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobe Gryce air jes the man I'm always wantin' ter hear a word about. Jes
      perceed with yer rat-killin'. I'm with ye.&rdquo; And Luke Todd placed his
      elbows on his knees and leaned forward with an air of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peters looked at him, hardly comprehending this ebullition. It was not
      what he had expected to elicit. No one laughed. His fleer was wide of the
      mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al&rdquo;&mdash;he made another effort&mdash;&ldquo;Tobe, we war jes sayin', ain't
      fitten fur ter be ranger o' the county. He be ez peart in gittin' ter own
      other folkses' stray cattle ez he war in courtin' other folkses'
      sweetheart, an', ef the truth mus' be knowed, in marryin' her.&rdquo; He
      suddenly twisted round, in some danger of falling from his perch. &ldquo;I want
      ter ax one o' them thar big-headed lawyers a question on a p'int o' law,&rdquo;
       he broke off, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What be Tobe Gryce a-doin' of now?&rdquo; asked Luke Todd, with eager interest
      in the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al,&rdquo; resumed Peters, nowise loath to return to the gossip, &ldquo;Tobe, ye
      see, air the ranger o' this hyar county, an' by law all the stray horses
      ez air tuk up by folks hev ter be reported ter him, an' appraised by two
      householders, an' swore to afore the magistrate an' be advertised by the
      ranger, an' ef they ain't claimed 'fore twelve months, the taker-up kin
      pay into the county treasury one-haffen the appraisement an' hev the
      critter fur his'n. An' the owner can't prove it away arter that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanky,&rdquo; said Luke Todd, dryly. &ldquo;S'pose ye teach yer gran'mammy ter suck
      aigs. I knowed all that afore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peters was abashed, and with some difficulty collected himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I knowed ye knowed it, Luke,&rdquo; he hastily conceded. &ldquo;But hyar be what
      I'm a-lookin' at&mdash;the law 'ain't got no pervision fur a stray horse
      ez kem of a dark night, 'thout nobody's percuremint, ter the ranger's own
      house. Now, the p'int o' law ez I wanted ter ax the lawyers 'bout air this&mdash;kin
      the ranger be the ranger an' the taker-up too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his eyes upon the great landscape lying beneath, flooded with
      the chill matutinal sunshine, and flecked here and there with the elusive
      shadow's of the fleecy drifting clouds. Far away the long horizontal lines
      of the wooded spurs, converging on either side of the valley and rising
      one behind the other, wore a subdued azure, all unlike the burning blue of
      summer, and lay along the calm, passionless sky, that itself was of a dim,
      repressed tone. On the slopes nearer, the leafless boughs, massed
      together, had purplish-garnet depths of color wherever the sunshine struck
      aslant, and showed richly against the faintly tinted horizon. Here and
      there among the boldly jutting gray crags hung an evergreen-vine, and from
      a gorge on the opposite mountain gleamed a continuous flash, like the
      waving of a silver plume, where a cataract sprang down the rocks. In the
      depths of the valley, a field in which crab-grass had grown in the place
      of the harvested wheat showed a tiny square of palest yellow, and beside
      it a red clay road, running over a hill, was visible. Above all a hawk was
      flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afore the winter fairly set in las' year,&rdquo; Peters resumed, presently, &ldquo;a
      stray kem ter Tobe's house. He 'lowed ter me ez he fund her a-standin' by
      the fodder-stack a-pullin' off'n it. An' he 'quired round, an' he never
      hearn o' no owner. I reckon he never axed outside o' Lonesome,&rdquo; he added,
      cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He puffed industriously at his pipe for a few moments; then continued:
      &ldquo;Wa'al, he 'lowed he couldn't feed the critter fur fun. An' he couldn't
      work her till she war appraised an' sech, that bein' agin the law fur
      strays. So he jes ondertook ter be ranger an' taker-up too&mdash;the
      bangedest consarn in the kentry! Ef the leetle mare hed been wall-eyed, or
      lame, or ennything, he wouldn't hev wanted ter be ranger an' taker-up too.
      But she air the peartest little beastis&mdash;she war jes bridle-wise when
      she fust kem&mdash;young an' spry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luke Todd was about to ask a question, but Peters, disregarding him,
      persisted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, Tobe tuk up the beastis, an' I reckon he reported her ter hisself,
      bein' the ranger&mdash;the critter makes me laff&mdash;an' he hed that
      thar old haffen-blind uncle o' his'n an' Perkins Bates, ez be never sober,
      ter appraise the vally o' the mare, an' I s'pose he delivered thar
      certificate ter hisself, an' I reckon he tuk oath that she kem 'thout his
      procure<i>mint</i> ter his place, in the presence o' the ranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon thar ain't no law agin the ranger's bein' a ranger an' a
      taker-up too,&rdquo; put in one of the bystanders. &ldquo;'Tain't like a sher'ff 's
      buyin' at his own sale. An' he hed ter pay haffen her vally into the
      treasury o' the county arter twelve months, ef the owner never proved her
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar ain't no sign he ever paid a cent,&rdquo; said Peters, with a malicious
      grin, pointing at the charred remains of the court-house, &ldquo;an' the
      treasurer air jes dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, Tobe hed ter make a report ter the jedge o' the county court every
      six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers of his office air cinders,&rdquo; retorted Peters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, then,&rdquo; argued the optimist, &ldquo;the stray-book will show ez she war
      reported an' sech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ranger took mighty partic'lar pains ter hev his stray-book in that
      thar court-house when 'twar burnt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause while the party sat ruminating upon the suspicions
      thus suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke Todd heard them, not without a thrill of satisfaction. He found them
      easy to adopt. And he, too, had a disposition to theorize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes a mighty mean man ter steal a horse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Stealin' a horse
      air powerful close ter murder. Folkses' lives fairly depend on a horse ter
      work thar corn an' sech, an' make a support fur em. I hev' knowed folks
      ter kem mighty close ter starvin' through hevin thar horse stole. Why,
      even that thar leetle filly of our'n, though she hedn't been fairly bruk
      ter the plough, war mightily missed. We-uns hed ter make out with the old
      sorrel, ez air nigh fourteen year old, ter work the crap, an' we war
      powerful disappointed. But we ain't never fund no trace o' the filly sence
      she war tolled off one night las' fall a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hawk floating above the valley and its winged shadow disappeared
      together in the dense glooms of a deep gorge. Luke Todd watched them as
      they vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he lifted his eyes. They were wide with a new speculation. An
      angry flare blazed in them. &ldquo;What sort'n beastis is this hyar mare ez the
      ranger tuk up?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peters looked at him, hardly comprehending his tremor of excitement.
      &ldquo;Seems sorter sizable,&rdquo; he replied, sibilantly, sucking his pipe-stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Todd nodded meditatively several times, leaning his elbows on his knees,
      his eyes fixed on the landscape. &ldquo;Hev she got enny particular marks, ez ye
      knows on?&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, she be ez black ez a crow, with the nigh fore-foot white. An' she
      hev got a white star spang in the middle o' her forehead, an' the left
      side o' her nose is white too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Todd rose suddenly to his feet. &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; he cried, with a burst of
      passion, &ldquo;she air <i>my</i> filly! An' 'twar that thar durned horse-thief
      of a ranger ez tolled her off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Deep among the wooded spurs Lonesome Cove nestles, sequestered from the
      world. Naught emigrates thence except an importunate stream that forces
      its way through a rocky gap, and so to freedom beyond. No stranger
      intrudes; only the moon looks in once in a while. The roaming wind may
      explore its solitudes; and it is but the vertical sunbeams that strike to
      the heart of the little basin, because of the massive mountains that wall
      it round and serve to isolate it. So nearly do they meet at the gap that
      one great assertive crag, beetling far above, intercepts the view of the
      wide landscape beyond, leaving its substituted profile jaggedly serrating
      the changing sky. Above it, when the weather is fair, appear vague blue
      lines, distant mountain summits, cloud strata, visions. Below its jutting
      verge may be caught glimpses of the widening valley without. But
      pre-eminent, gaunt, sombre, it sternly dominates &ldquo;Lonesome,&rdquo; and is the
      salient feature of the little world it limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tobe Gryce's house, gray, weather-beaten, moss-grown, had in comparison an
      ephemeral, modern aspect. For a hundred years its inmates had come and
      gone and lived and died. They took no heed of the crag, but never a sound
      was lost upon it. Their drawling iterative speech the iterative echoes
      conned. The ringing blast of a horn set astir some phantom chase in the
      air. When the cows came lowing home, there were lowing herds in viewless
      company. Even if one of the children sat on a rotting log crooning a
      vague, fragmentary ditty, some faint-voiced spirit in the rock would sing.
      Lonesome Cove?&mdash;home of invisible throngs!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the ranger trotted down the winding road, multitudinous hoof-beats, as
      of a troop of cavalry, heralded his approach to the little girl who stood
      on the porch of the log-cabin and watched for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hy're, Cunnel!&rdquo; he cried, cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the little &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; took no heed. She looked beyond him at the vague
      blue mountains, against which the great grim rock was heavily imposed,
      every ledge, every waving dead crisp weed, distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed the smoke curling briskly up in the sunshine from the clay and
      slick chimney. He strode past her into the house, as Eugenia, with all
      semblance of youth faded from her countenance, haggard and hollow-eyed in
      the morning light, was hurrying the corn-dodgers and venison steak on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he did not appreciate that the women were pining with curiosity,
      for he vouchsafed no word of the excitements in the little town; and he
      himself was ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails the Cunnel, 'Genie?&rdquo; he asked, presently, glancing up sharply
      from under his hat brim, and speaking with his mouth full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cat 'pears ter hev got her tongue,&rdquo; said Eugenia, intending that the
      &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; should hear, and perhaps profit. &ldquo;She ain't able ter talk none
      this mornin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little body cast so frowning a glance upon them as she stood in the
      doorway that her expression was but slightly less lowering than her
      father's. It was an incongruous demonstration, with her infantile
      features, her little yellow head, and the slight physical force she
      represented. She wore a blue cotton frock, fastened up the back with great
      horn buttons; she had on shoes laced with leather strings; one of her blue
      woollen stockings fell over her ankle, disclosing the pinkest of plump
      calves; the other stocking was held in place by an unabashed cotton
      string. She had a light in her dark eyes and a color in her cheek, and
      albeit so slight a thing, she wielded a strong coercion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws-a-massy, Cunnel!&rdquo; said Tobe, in a harried manner, &ldquo;couldn't ye find
      me nowhar? I'm powerful sorry. I couldn't git back hyar no sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But not in this wise was she to be placated. She fixed her eyes upon him,
      but made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly rose from his half-finished breakfast. &ldquo;Look-a-hyar, Cunnel,&rdquo;
       he cried, joyously, &ldquo;don't ye want ter ride the filly?&mdash;ye knew ye
      hanker ter ride the filly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even then she tried to frown, but the bliss of the prospect overbore her.
      Her cheek and chin dimpled, and there was a gurgling display of two rows
      of jagged little teeth as the doughty &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; was swung to his shoulder
      and he stepped out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as he stood by the glossy black mare and lifted the child to
      the saddle. The animal arched her neck and turned her head and gazed back
      at him curiously. &ldquo;Hold on tight, Cunnel,&rdquo; he said as he looked up at her,
      his face strangely softened almost beyond recognition. And she gurgled and
      laughed and screamed with delight as he began to slowly lead the mare
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; had the gift of continuance. Some time elapsed before she
      exhausted the joys of exaltation. More than once she absolutely refused to
      dismount. Tobe patiently led the beast up and down, and the &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; rode
      in state. It was only when the sun had grown high, and occasionally she
      was fain to lift her chubby hands to her eyes, imperiling her safety on
      the saddle, that he ventured to seriously remonstrate, and finally she
      permitted herself to be assisted to the ground. When, with the little girl
      at his heels, he reached the porch, he took off his hat, and wiped the
      perspiration from his brow with his great brown hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell ye, jouncin' round arter the Cunnel air powerful hot work,&rdquo; he
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he paused. His wife had come to the door, and there was a
      strange expression of alarm among the anxious lines of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobe,&rdquo; she said, in a bated voice, &ldquo;who war them men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, whirled about, surveyed the vacant landscape, and once
      more turned dumfound-ed toward her. &ldquo;What men?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them men ez acted so cur'ous,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I couldn't see thar faces
      plain, an' I dunno who they war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar war they?&rdquo; And he looked over his shoulder once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yander along the ledges of the big rock. Thar war two of 'em, hidin'
      ahint that thar jagged aidge. An' ef yer back war turned they'd peep out
      at ye an' the Cunnel ridin'. But whenst ye would face round agin, they'd
      drap down ahint the aidge o' the rock. I 'lowed wunst ez I'd holler ter
      ye, but I war feared ye moughtn't keer ter know.&rdquo; Her voice fell in its
      deprecatory cadence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stodd in silent perplexity. &ldquo;Ye air a fool, 'Genie, an' ye never seen
      nuthin'. Nobody hev got enny call ter spy on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped in-doors, took down his rifle from the rack, and went out
      frowning into the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion of mystery angered him. He had a vague sense of impending
      danger. As he made his way along the slope toward the great beetling crag
      all his faculties were on the alert. He saw naught unusual when he stood
      upon its dark-seamed summit, and he went cautiously to the verge and
      looked down at the many ledges. They jutted out at irregular intervals,
      the first only six feet below, and all accessible enough to an expert
      climber. A bush grew in a niche. An empty nest, riddled by the wind, hung
      dishevelled from a twig. Coarse withered grass tufted the crevices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far below he saw the depths of the Cove&mdash;the tops of the leafless
      trees, and, glimpsed through the interlacing boughs, the rush of a
      mountain rill, and a white flash as a sunbeam slanted on the foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was turning away, all incredulous, when with a sudden start he looked
      back. On one of the ledges was a slight depression. It was filled with
      sand and earth. Imprinted upon it was the shape of a man's foot. The
      ranger paused and gazed fixedly at it. &ldquo;Wa'al, by the Lord!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      under his breath. Presently, &ldquo;But they hev no call!&rdquo; he. argued. Then once
      more, softly, &ldquo;By the Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mystery baffled him. More than once that day he went up to the crag
      and stood and stared futilely at the footprint. Conjecture had license and
      limitations, too. As the hours wore on he became harassed by the sense of
      espionage. He was a bold man before the foes he knew, but this idea of
      inimical lurking, of furtive scrutiny for unknown purposes, preyed upon
      him. He brooded over it as he sat idle by the fire. Once he went to the
      door and stared speculatively at the great profile of the cliff. The sky
      above it was all a lustrous amber, for the early sunset of the shortest
      days of the year was at hand. The mountains, seen partly above and partly
      below it, wore a glamourous purple. There were clouds, and from their
      rifts long divergent lines of light slanted down upon the valley, distinct
      among their shadows. The sun was not visible&mdash;only in the western
      heavens was a half-veiled effulgence too dazzlingly white to be gazed
      upon. The ranger shaded his eyes with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      No motion, no sound; for the first time in his life the unutterable
      loneliness of the place impressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Genie,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, looking over his shoulder within the cabin,
      &ldquo;be you-uns <i>sure</i> ez they war&mdash;<i>folks?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno what you mean,&rdquo; she faltered, her eyes dilated. &ldquo;They <i>looked</i>
      like folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon they war,&rdquo; he said, reassuring himself. &ldquo;The Lord knows I hope
      they war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      That night the wind rose. The stars all seemed to have burst from their
      moorings, and were wildly adrift in the sky. There was a broken tumult of
      billowy clouds, and the moon tossed hopelessly amongst them, a lunar
      wreck, sometimes on her beam ends, sometimes half submerged, once more
      gallantly struggling to the surface, and again sunk. The bare boughs of
      the trees beat together in a dirgelike monotone. Now and again a leaf went
      sibilantly whistling past. The wild commotion of the heavens and earth was
      visible, for the night was not dark. The ranger, standing within the rude
      stable of unhewn logs, all undaubed, noted how pale were the horizontal
      bars of gray light alternating with the black logs of the wall. He was
      giving the mare a feed of corn, but he had not brought his lantern, as was
      his custom. That mysterious espionage had in some sort shaken his courage,
      and he felt the obscurity a shield. He had brought, instead, his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equine form was barely visible among the glooms. Now and then, as the
      mare noisily munched, she lifted a hoof and struck it upon the ground with
      a dull thud. How the gusts outside were swirling up the gorge! The pines
      swayed and sighed. Again the boughs of the chestnut-oak above the roof
      crashed together. Did a fitful blast stir the door?
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his eyes mechanically. A cold thrill ran through every fibre.
      For there, close by the door, somebody&mdash;something&mdash;was peering
      through the space between the logs of the wall. The face was invisible,
      but the shape of a man's head was distinctly defined. He realized that it
      was no supernatural manifestation when a husky voice began to call the
      mare, in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;Cobe! Cobe! Cobe!&rdquo; With a galvanic start he
      was about to spring forward to hold the door. A hand from without was laid
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed the muzzle of his gun between the logs, a jet of red light was
      suddenly projected into the darkness, the mare was rearing and plunging
      violently, the little shanty was surcharged with roar and reverberation,
      and far and wide the crags and chasms echoed the report of the rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a vague clamor outside, an oath, a cry of pain. Hasty footfalls
      sounded among the dead leaves and died in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ranger ventured out he saw the door of his house wide open, and
      the firelight flickering out among the leafless bushes. His wife met him
      halfway down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air ye hurt, Tobe?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Did yer gun go off suddint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty suddint,&rdquo; he replied, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye didn't fire it a-purpose?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edzactly so,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye never hurt nobody, did ye, Tobe?&rdquo; She had turned very pale. &ldquo;I 'lowed
      it couldn't be the wind ez I hearn a-hollerin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hopes an' prays I hurt 'em,&rdquo; he said, as he replaced the rifle in the
      rack. He was shaking the other hand, which had been jarred in some way by
      the hasty discharge of the weapon. &ldquo;Some dad-burned horse-thief war arter
      the mare. Jedgin' from the sound o' thar running 'peared like to me ez
      thar mought be two o' 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the mare disappeared from the stable. Yet she could not be
      far off, for Tobe was about the house most of the time, and when he and
      the &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; came in-doors in the evening the little girl held in her
      hand a half-munched ear of corn, evidently abstracted from the mare's
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar be the filly hid, Tobe?&rdquo; Eugenia asked, curiosity overpowering her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ax me no questions an' I'll tell ye no lies,&rdquo; he replied, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning there was a fall of snow, and she had some doubt whether
      her mother, who had gone several days before to a neighbor's on the summit
      of the range, would return; but presently the creak of unoiled axles
      heralded the approach of a wagon, and soon the old woman, bundled in
      shawls, was sitting by the fire. She wore heavy woollen socks over her
      shoes as protection against the snow. The incompatibility of the shape of
      the hose with the human foot was rather marked, and as they were somewhat
      inelastic as well, there was a muscular struggle to get them off only
      exceeded by the effort which had been required to get them on. She shook
      her head again and again, with a red face, as she bent over the socks, but
      plainly more than this discomfort vexed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws-a-massy, 'Genie! I hearn a awful tale over yander 'mongst them
      Jenkins folks. Ye oughter hev married Luke Todd, an' so I tole ye an'
      fairly beset ye ter do ten year ago. <i>He</i> keered fur ye. An' Tobe&mdash;shucks!
      Wa'al, laws-a-massy, child! I hearn a awful tale 'bout Tobe up yander at
      Jenkinses'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks hed better take keer how they talk 'bout Tobe,&rdquo; she said, with a
      touch of pride. &ldquo;They be powerful keerful ter do it out'n rifle range.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one more mighty tug the sock came off, the red face was lifted, and
      Mrs. Pearce shook her head ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bible say 'words air foolishness.' Ye dun-no what ye air talkin'
      'bout, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this melancholy preamble she detailed the gossip that had arisen at
      the county town and pervaded the country-side. Eugenia commented, denied,
      flashed into rage, then lapsed into silence. Although it did not constrain
      credulity, there was something that made her afraid when her mother said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye hed better not be talkin' 'bout rifle range so brash, 'Genie, nohows.
      They 'lowed ez Luke Todd an' Sam Peters kem hyar&mdash;'twar jes night
      before las'&mdash;aimin' ter take the mare away 'thout no words an' no
      lawin', 'kase they didn't want ter wait. Luke hed got a chance ter view
      the mare, an' knowed ez she war hisn. An' Tobe war hid in the dark beside
      the mare, an' fired at 'em, an' the rifle-ball tuk Sam right through the
      beam o' his arm. I reckon, though, ez that warn't true, else ye would hev
      knowed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up anxiously over her spectacles at her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hearn Tobe shoot,&rdquo; faltered Eugenia. &ldquo;I seen blood on the leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws-a-massy!&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman, irritably. &ldquo;I be fairly feared
      ter bide hyar; 'twouldn't s'prise me none ef they kem hyar an' hauled Tobe
      out an' lynched him an' sech, an' who knows who mought git hurt in the
      scrimmage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both fell silent as the ranger strode in. They would need a braver
      heart than either bore to reveal to him the suspicions of horse-stealing
      sown broadcast over the mountain. Eugenia felt that this in itself was
      coercive evidence of his innocence. Who dared so much as say a word to his
      face?
    </p>
    <p>
      The weight of the secret asserted itself, however. As she went about her
      accustomed tasks, all bereft of their wonted interest, vapid and
      burdensome, she carried so woe-begone a face that it caught his attention,
      and he demanded, angrily,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails ye ter look so durned peaked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This did not abide long in his memory, however, and it cost her a pang to
      see him so unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out upon the porch late that afternoon to judge of the weather.
      Snow was falling again. The distant summits had disappeared. The mountains
      near at hand loomed through the myriads of serried white flakes. A crow
      flew across the Cove in its midst. It heavily thatched the cabin, and
      tufts dislodged by the opening of the door fell down upon her hair. Drifts
      lay about the porch. Each rail of the fence was laden. The ground, the
      rocks, were deeply covered. She reflected with satisfaction that the red
      splotch of blood on the dead leaves was no longer visible. Then a sudden
      idea struck her that took her breath away. She came in, her cheeks
      flushed, her eyes bright, with an excited dubitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband commented on the change. &ldquo;Ye air a powerful cur'ous critter,
      'Genie,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;a while ago ye looked some fower or five hundred year
      old&mdash;now ye favors yerself when I fust kem a-courtin' round the
      settlemint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hardly knew whether the dull stir in her heart were pleasure or pain.
      Her eyes filled with tears, and the irradiated iris shone through them
      with a liquid lustre. She could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother took ephemeral advantage of his softening mood. &ldquo;Ye useter be
      mighty perlite and saaft-spoken in them days, Tobe,&rdquo; she ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hed ter be,&rdquo; he admitted, frankly, &ldquo;'kase thar war sech a many o' them
      mealy-mouthed cusses a-waitin' on 'Genie. The kentry 'peared ter me ter
      bristle with Luke Todd; he 'minded me o' brumsaidge&mdash;<i>everywhar</i>
      ye seen his yaller head, ez homely an' ez onwelcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never wunst gin Luke a thought arter ye tuk ter comin' round the
      settlemint,&rdquo; Eugenia said, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wisht I hed knowed that then,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;else I wouldn't hev been so
      all-fired oneasy an' beset I wasted mo' time a-studyin' 'bout ye an' Luke
      Todd 'n ye war both wuth, an' went 'thout my vittles an' sot up o' nights.
      Ef I hed spent that time a-moanin' fur my sins an' settin' my soul at
      peace, I'd be 'quirin' roun' the throne o' Grace now! Young folks air
      powerful fursaken fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow her heart was warmer for this allusion. She was more hopeful. Her
      resolve grew stronger and stronger as she sat and knitted, and looked at
      the fire and saw among the coals all her old life at the settlement newly
      aglow. She was remembering now that Luke Todd had been as wax in her
      hands. She recalled that when she was married there was a gleeful &ldquo;sayin'&rdquo;
       going the rounds of the mountain that he had taken to the woods with
      grief, and he was heard of no more for weeks. The gossips relished his
      despair as the corollary of the happy bridal. He had had no reproaches for
      her. He had only looked the other way when they met, and she had not
      spoken to him since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He set store by my word in them days,&rdquo; she said to herself, her lips
      vaguely moving. &ldquo;I misdoubts ef he hev furgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All through the long hours of the winter night she silently canvassed her
      plan. The house was still noiseless and dark when she softly opened the
      door and softly closed it behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had ceased to snow, and the sky had cleared. The trees, all the limbs
      whitened, were outlined distinctly upon it, and through the boughs
      overhead a brilliant star, aloof and splendid, looked coldly down. Along
      dark spaces Orion had drawn his glittering blade. Above the snowy
      mountains a melancholy waning moon was swinging. The valley was full of
      mist, white and shining where the light fell upon it, a vaporous purple
      where the shadows held sway. So still it was! the only motion in all the
      world the throbbing stars and her palpitating heart. So solemnly silent!
      It was a relief, as she trudged on and on, to note a gradual change; to
      watch the sky withdraw, seeming fainter; to see the moon grow filmy, like
      some figment of the frost; to mark the gray mist steal on apace, wrap
      mountain, valley, and heaven with mystic folds, shut out all vision of
      things familiar. Through it only the sense of dawn could creep.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      She recognized the locality; her breath was short; her step quickened. She
      appeared, like an apparition out of the mists, close to a fence, and
      peered through the snow-laden rails. A sudden pang pierced her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there, within the enclosure, milking the cow, she saw, all blooming in
      the snow&mdash;herself; the azalea-like girl she had been!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not known how dear to her was that bright young identity she
      remembered. She had not realized how far it had gone from her. She felt a
      forlorn changeling looking upon her own estranged estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint cry escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow, with lifted head and a muttered low of surprise, moved out of
      reach of the milker, who, half kneeling upon the ground, stared with wide
      blue eyes at her ghost in the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. It was only a moment before Eugenia spoke; it seemed
      years, so charged it was with retrospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kem over hyar ter hev a word with ye,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of a human voice Luke Todd's wife struggled to her feet She
      held the piggin with one arm encircled about it, and with the other hand
      she clutched the plaid shawl around her throat. Her bright hair was tossed
      by the rising wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'lowed I'd find ye hyar a-milkin' 'bout now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The homely allusion reassured the younger woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev ter begin toler'ble early,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Spot gins 'bout a gallon a
      milkin' now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spot's calf, which subsisted on what was left over, seemed to find it
      cruel that delay should be added to his hardships, and he lifted up his
      voice in a plaintive remonstrance. This reminded Mrs. Todd of his
      existence; she turned and let down the bars that served to exclude him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was staring at her very hard. Somehow she quailed under that
      look. Though it was fixed upon her in unvarying intensity, it had a
      strange impersonality. This woman was not seeing her, despite that wide,
      wistful, yearning gaze; she was thinking of something else, seeing some
      one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly Luke Todd's wife began to stare at the visitor very hard, and
      to think of something that was not before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I be the ranger's wife,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;I kem over hyar ter tell ye he
      never tuk yer black mare nowise but honest, bein' the ranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She found it difficult to say more. Under that speculative, unseeing look
      she too faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me ez Luke Todd air powerful outed 'bout'n it. An' I 'lowed ef
      he knowed from me ez 'twar tuk fair, he'd b'lieve me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. Her courage was flagging; her hope had fled. The eyes of
      the man's wife burned upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-uns useter be toler'ble well 'quainted 'fore he ever seen ye, an' I
      'lowed he'd b'lieve my word,&rdquo; Eugenia continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another silence. The sun was rising; long liquescent lines of light of
      purest amber-color were streaming through the snowy woods; the shadows of
      the fence rails alternated with bars of dazzling glister; elusive
      prismatic gleams of rose and lilac and blue shimmered on every slope&mdash;thus
      the winter flowered. Tiny snow-birds were hopping about; a great dog came
      down from the little snow-thatched cabin, and was stretching himself
      elastically and yawning most portentously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I 'lowed I'd see ye an' git you-uns ter tell him that word from me,
      an' then he'd b'lieve it,&rdquo; said Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger woman nodded mechanically, still gazing at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And was this her mission! Somehow it had lost its urgency. Where was its
      potency, her enthusiasm? Eugenia realized that her feet were wet, her
      skirts draggled; that she was chilled to the bone and trembling violently.
      She looked about her doubtfully. Then her eyes came back to the face of
      the woman before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye'll tell him, I s'pose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Luke Todd's wife nodded mechanically, still staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing further to be said. A vacant interval ensued. Then, &ldquo;I
      'lowed I'd tell ye,&rdquo; Eugenia reiterated, vaguely, and turned away,
      vanishing with the vanishing mists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke Todd's wife stood gazing at the fence through which the apparition
      had peered. She could see yet her own face there, grown old and worn. The
      dog wagged his tail and pressed against her, looking up and claiming her
      notice. Once more he stretched himself elastically and yawned widely, with
      shrill variations of tone. The calf was frisking about in awkward bovine
      elation, and now and then the cow affectionately licked its coat with the
      air of making its toilet. An assertive chanticleer was proclaiming the
      dawn within the henhouse, whence came too an impatient clamor, for the
      door, which served to exclude any marauding fox, was still closed upon the
      imprisoned poultry. Still she looked steadily at the fence where the
      ranger's wife had stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That thar woman favors me,&rdquo; she said, presently. And suddenly she burst
      into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was well that Eugenia could not see Luke Todd's expression as
      his wife recounted the scene. She gave it truly, but without, alas! the
      glamour of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She 'lowed ez ye'd b'lieve her, bein' ez ye use-ter be 'quainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face flushed. &ldquo;Wa'al, sir! the insurance o' that thar woman!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;I war 'quainted with her; I war mighty well 'quainted with
      her.&rdquo; He had a casual remembrance of those days when &ldquo;he tuk ter the woods
      ter wear out his grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never gin me no promise, but me an' her war courtin' some. Sech
      dependence ez I put on her war mightily wasted. I dunno what ails the
      critter ter 'low ez I set store by her word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Eugenia! There is nothing so dead as ashes. His flame had clean
      burned out. So far afield were all his thoughts that he stood amazed when
      his wife, with a sudden burst of tears, declared passionately that she
      knew it&mdash;she saw it&mdash;she favored Eugenia Gryce. She had found
      out that he had married her because she looked like another woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Genie Gryce hev got powerful little ter do ter kem a-jouncin' through
      the snow over hyar ter try ter set ye an' me agin one another,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, angrily. &ldquo;Stealin' the filly ain't enough ter sati'fy her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife was in some sort mollified. She sought to reassure herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air we-uns of a favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; he replied, sulkily. &ldquo;I 'ain't seen the critter fur nigh on ter
      ten year. I hev furgot the looks of her. 'Pears like ter me,&rdquo; he went on,
      ruminating, &ldquo;ez 'twar in my mind when I fust seen ye ez thar war a favor
      'twixt ye. But I misdoubts now. Do she 'low ez I hev hed nuthin ter study
      'bout sence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Eugenia is not the only woman who overrates the strength of a
      sentimental attachment. A gloomy intuition of failure kept her company all
      the lengthening way home. The chill splendors of the wintry day grated
      upon her dreary mood. How should she care for the depth and richness of
      the blue deepening toward the zenith in those vast skies? What was it to
      her that the dead vines, climbing the grim rugged crags, were laden with
      tufts and corollated shapes wherever these fantasies of flowers might
      cling, or that the snow flashed with crystalline scintillations? She only
      knew that they glimmered and dazzled upon the tears in her eyes, and she
      was moved to shed them afresh. She did not wonder whether her venture had
      resulted amiss. She only wondered that she had tried aught. And she was
      humbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached Lonesome Cove she found the piggin where she had hid it,
      and milked the cow in haste. It was no great task, for the animal was
      going dry. &ldquo;Their'n gins a gallon a milkin',&rdquo; she said, in rueful
      comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she came up the slope with the piggin on her head, her husband was
      looking down from the porch with a lowering brow. &ldquo;Why n't ye spen' the
      day a-milkin' the cow?&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;Dawdlin' yander in the cow-pen till
      this time in the mornin'! An' ter-morrer's Chrismus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word smote upon her weary heart with a dull pain. She had no cultured
      phrase to characterize the sensation as a presentiment, but she was
      conscious of the prophetic process. To-night &ldquo;all the mounting&rdquo; would be
      riotous with that dubious hilarity known as &ldquo;Chrismus in the bones,&rdquo; and
      there was no telling what might come from the combined orgy and an
      inflamed public spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered the familiar doom of the mountain horse-thief, the men
      lurking on the cliff, the inimical feeling against the ranger. She
      furtively watched him with forebodings as he came and went at intervals
      throughout the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk had fallen when he suddenly looked in and beckoned to the &ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo;
       who required him to take her with him whenever he fed the mare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tie this hyar comforter over the Cunnel's head,&rdquo; Eugenia said, as
      he bundled the child in a shawl and lifted her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tain't no use,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The Cunnel ain't travellin' fur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard him step from the creaking porch. She heard the dreary wind
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, the clumsy shadows of the warping-bars, the spinning-wheel, and
      the churn were dancing in the firelight on the wall. The supper was
      cooking on the live coals. The children, popping corn in the ashes, were
      laughing; as her eye fell upon the &ldquo;Colonel's&rdquo; vacant little chair her
      mind returned to the child's excursion with her father, and again she
      wondered futilely where the mare could be hid. The next moment she was
      heartily glad that she did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like the fulfillment of some dreadful dream when the door opened. A
      man entered softly, slowly; the flickering fire showed his shadow&mdash;was
      it?&mdash;nay, another man, and still another, and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old crone in the corner sprang up, screaming in a shrill, tremulous,
      cracked voice. For they were masked. Over the face of each dangled a bit
      of homespun, with great empty sockets through which eyes vaguely glanced.
      Even the coarse fibre of the intruders responded to that quavering,
      thrilling appeal. One spoke instantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws-a-massy! Mis' Pearce, don't ye feel interrupted none&mdash;nor Mis'
      Gryce nuther. We-uns ain't harmful noways&mdash;jes want ter know whar
      that thar black mare hev disappeared to. She ain't in the barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his great eye-sockets on Eugenia. The plaid homespun mask
      dangling about his face was grotesquely incongruous with his intent,
      serious gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; she faltered; &ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had caught at the spinning-wheel for support. The fire crackled. The
      baby was counting aloud the grains of corn popping from the ashes. &ldquo;Six,
      two, free,&rdquo; he babbled. The kettle merrily sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man still stared silently at the ranger's wife. The expression in his
      eyes changed suddenly. He chuckled derisively. The others echoed his
      mocking mirth. &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; they laughed aloud; and the eye-sockets in
      the homespun masks all glared significantly at each other. Even the dog
      detected something sinister in this laughter. He had been sniffing about
      the heels of the strangers; he bristled now, showed his teeth, and
      growled. The spokesman hastily kicked him in the ribs, and the animal fled
      yelping to the farther side of the fireplace behind the baby, where he
      stood and barked defiance. The rafters rang with the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one on the porch without spoke to the leader in a low voice. This
      man, who seemed to have a desire to conceal his identity which could not
      be served by a mask, held the door with one hand that the wind might not
      blow it wide open. The draught fanned the fire. Once the great bowing,
      waving white blaze sent a long, quivering line of light through the narrow
      aperture, and Eugenia saw the dark lurking figure outside. He had one arm
      in a sling. She needed no confirmation to assure her that this was Sam
      Peters, whom her husband had shot at the stable door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leader instantly accepted his suggestion. &ldquo;Wa'al, Mis' Gryce, I reckon
      ye dunno whar Tobe be, nuther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, I dunno,&rdquo; she said, in a tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The homespun mask swayed with the distortions of his face as he sneered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye mean ter say ye don't 'low ter tell us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno whar he be.&rdquo; Her voice had sunk to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another exchange of glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, ma'am, jes gin us the favor of a light by yer fire, an' we-uns 'll
      find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped swiftly forward, thrust a pine torch into the coals, and with
      it all whitely flaring ran out into the night; the others followed his
      example; and the terror-stricken women, hastily barring up the door,
      peered after them through the little batten shutter of the window.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The torches were already scattered about the slopes of Lonesome Cove like
      a fallen constellation. What shafts of white light they cast upon the snow
      in the midst of the dense blackness of the night! Somehow they seemed
      endowed with volition, as they moved hither and thither, for their
      brilliancy almost cancelled the figures of the men that bore them&mdash;only
      an occasional erratic shapeless shadow was visible. Now and then a flare
      pierced the icicle-tipped holly bushes, and again there was a fibrous
      glimmer in the fringed pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search was terribly silent. The snow deadened the tread. Only the wind
      was loud among the muffled trees, and sometimes a dull thud sounded when
      the weight of snow fell from the evergreen laurel as the men thrashed
      through its dense growth. They separated after a time, and only here and
      there an isolated stellular light illumined the snow, and conjured white
      mystic circles into the wide spaces of the darkness. The effort flagged at
      last, and its futility sharpened the sense of injury in Luke Todd's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alone now, close upon the great rock, and looking at its jagged
      ledges all cloaked with snow. Above those soft white outlines drawn
      against the deep clear sky the frosty stars scintillated. Beneath were the
      abysmal depths of the valley masked by the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pride was touched. In the old quarrel his revenge had been hampered,
      for it was the girl's privilege to choose, and she had chosen. He cared
      nothing for that now, but he felt it indeed a reproach to tamely let this
      man take his horse when he had all the mountain at his back. There was a
      sharp humiliation in his position. He felt the pressure of public opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad-burn him!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Ef I kin make out ter git a glimge o' him,
      I'll shoot him dead&mdash;dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned the rifle against the rock. It struck upon a ledge. A metallic
      vibration rang out. Again and again the sound was repeated&mdash;now loud,
      still clanging; now faint, but clear; now soft and away to a doubtful
      murmur which he hardly was sure that he heard. Never before had he known
      such an echo. And suddenly he recollected that this was the great &ldquo;Talking
      Rock,&rdquo; famed beyond the limits of Lonesome. It had traditions as well as
      echoes. He remembered vaguely that beneath this cliff there was said to be
      a cave which was utilized in the manufacture of saltpetre for gunpowder in
      the War of 1812.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked down the slope below he thought the snow seemed broken&mdash;by
      footprints, was it? With the expectation of a discovery strong upon him,
      he crept along a wide ledge of the crag, now and then stumbling and
      sending an avalanche of snow and ice and stones thundering to the foot of
      the cliff..He missed his way more than once. Then he would turn about,
      laboriously retracing his steps, and try another level of the ledges.
      Suddenly before him was the dark opening he sought. No creature had lately
      been here. It was filled with growing bushes and dead leaves and brambles.
      Looking again down upon the slope beneath, he felt very sure that he saw
      footprints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old folks useter 'low ez thar war two openings ter this hyar cave,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Tobe Gryce mought hev hid hyar through a opening down yan-der on
      the slope. But <i>I'll</i> go the way ez I hev hearn tell on, an' peek in,
      an' ef I kin git a glimge o' him, I'll make him tell me whar that thar
      filly air,&mdash;or I'll let daylight through him, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused only to bend aside the brambles, then he crept in and took his
      way along a low, narrow passage. It had many windings, but was without
      intersections or intricacy. He heard his own steps echoed like a pursuing
      footfall. His labored breathing returned in sighs from the inanimate
      rocks. It was an uncanny place, with strange, sepulchral, solemn effects.
      He shivered with the cold. A draught stole in from some secret crevice
      known only to the wild mountain winds. The torch flared, crouched before
      the gust, flared again, then darkness. He hesitated, took one step
      forward, and suddenly&mdash;a miracle!
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft aureola with gleaming radiations, a low, shadowy chamber, a beast
      feeding from a manger, and within it a child's golden head.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart gave a great throb. Somehow he was smitten to his knees.
      Christmas Eve! He remembered the day with a rush of emotion. He stared
      again at the vouchsafed vision. He rubbed his eyes. It had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only hallucination caused by an abrupt transition from darkness to light;
      only the most mundane facts of the old troughs and ash-hoppers, relics of
      the industry that had served the hideous carnage of battle; only the
      yellow head of the ranger's brat, who had climbed into one of them, from
      which the mare was calmly munching her corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/201.jpg" alt="Yet This Was Christmas Eve 201 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Yet this was Christmas Eve. And the Child did lie in a manger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was well for him that his ignorant faith could accept the
      illusion as a vision charged with all the benignities of peace on earth,
      good-will toward men. With a keen thrill in his heart, on his knees he
      drew the charge from his rifle, and flung it down a rift in the rocks.
      &ldquo;Chrismus Eve,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned his empty weapon against the wall, and strode out to the little
      girl who was perched up on the trough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chrismus gift, Cunnel!&rdquo; he cried, cheerily. &ldquo;Ter-morrer's Chrismus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The echoes caught the word. In vibratory jubilance they repeated it.
      &ldquo;Chrismus!&rdquo; rang from the roof, scintillating with calcspar; &ldquo;Chrismus!&rdquo;
       sounded from the colonnade of stalactites that hung down to meet the
      uprising stalagmites; &ldquo;Chrismus!&rdquo; repeated the walls incrusted with roses
      that, shut in from the light and the fresh air of heaven, bloomed forever
      in the stone. Was ever chorus so sweet as this?
    </p>
    <p>
      It reached Tobe Gryce, who stood at his improvised corn-bin. With a bundle
      of fodder still in his arms he stepped forward. There beside the little
      Colonel and the black mare he beheld a man seated upon an inverted
      half-bushel measure, peacefully lighting his pipe with a bunch of straws
      which he kindled at the lantern on the ash-hopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ranger's black eyes were wide with wonder at this intrusion, and
      angrily flashed. He connected it at once with the attack on the stable.
      The hair on his low forehead rose bristlingly as he frowned. Yet he
      realized with a quaking heart that he was helpless. He, although the crack
      shot of the county, would not have fired while the Colonel was within two
      yards of his mark for the State of Tennessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood his ground with stolid courage&mdash;a target.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a start of surprise, he perceived that the intruder was
      unarmed. Twenty feet away his rifle stood against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tobe Gryce was strangely shaken. He experienced a sudden revolt of
      credulity. This was surely a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't that thar Luke Todd? Why air ye a-wait-in' thar?&rdquo; he called out in
      a husky undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Todd glanced up, and took his pipe from his mouth; it was now fairly
      alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kase it be Chrismus Eve, Tobe,&rdquo; he said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ranger stared for a moment; then came forward and gave the fodder to
      the mare, pausing now and then and looking with oblique distrust down upon
      Luke Todd as he smoked his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want ter tell ye, Tobe, ez some o' the mounting boys air a-sarchin fur
      ye outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who air they?&rdquo; asked the ranger, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was so natural, his manner so unsuspecting, that a new doubt
      began to stir in Luke Todd's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails ye ter keep the mare down hyar, Tobe?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.
      &ldquo;Tears like ter me ez that be powerful comical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kase,&rdquo; said Tobe, reasonably, &ldquo;some durned horse-thieves kem arter her
      one night. I fired at t'em. I hain't hearn on 'em sence. An' so I jes hid
      the mare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Todd was puzzled. He shifted his pipe in his mouth. Finally he said: &ldquo;Some
      folks 'lowed ez ye hed no right ter take up that mare, bein' ez ye war the
      ranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tobe Gryce whirled round abruptly. &ldquo;What war I a-goin' ter do, then? Feed
      the critter fur nuthin till the triflin' scamp ez owned her kem arter her?
      I couldn't work her 'thout takin' her up an' hevin her appraised. Thar's a
      law agin sech. An' I couldn't git somebody ter toll her off an' take her
      up. That ain't fair. What ought I ter hev done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al,&rdquo; said Luke, drifting into argument, &ldquo;the town-folks 'low ez ye hev
      got nuthin ter prove it by, the stray-book an' records bein' burnt. The
      town-folks 'low ez ye can't prove by writin' an' sech ez ye ever tried ter
      find the owner.&rdquo; &ldquo;The town-folks air fairly sodden in foolishness,&rdquo;
       exclaimed the ranger, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his ample pocket a roll of ragged newspapers, and pointed
      with his great thumb at a paragraph. And Luke Todd read by the light of
      the lantern the advertisement and description of the estray printed
      according to law in the nearest newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper was so infrequent a factor in the lives of the mountain
      gossips that this refutation of their theory had never occurred to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheet was trembling in Luke Todd's hand; his eyes filled. The cavern
      with its black distances, its walls close at hand sparkling with delicate
      points of whitest light; the yellow flare of the lantern; the grotesque
      shadows on the ground; the fair little girl with her golden hair; the
      sleek black mare; the burly figure of the ranger&mdash;all the scene
      swayed before him. He remembered the gracious vision that had saluted him;
      he shuddered at the crime from which he was rescued. Pity him because he
      knew naught of the science of optics; of the bewildering effects of a
      sudden burst of light upon the delicate mechanism of the eye; of the
      vagaries of illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobe,&rdquo; he said, in a solemn voice&mdash;all the echoes were bated to awed
      whispers&mdash;&ldquo;I hev been gin ter view a vision this night, bein' 'twar
      Chris-mus Eve. An' now I want ter shake hands on it fur peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he told the whole story, regardless of the ranger's demonstrations,
      albeit they were sometimes violent enough. Tobe sprang up with a snort of
      rage, his eyes flashing, his thick tongue stumbling with the curses
      crowding upon it, when he realized the suspicions rife against him at the
      county town. But he stood with his clinched hand slowly relaxing, and with
      the vague expression which one wears who looks into the past, as he
      listened to the recital of Eugenia's pilgrimage in the snowy wintry dawn.
      &ldquo;Mighty few folks hev got a wife ez set store by 'em like that,&rdquo; Luke
      remarked, impersonally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ranger's rejoinder seemed irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Genie be a-goin' ter see a powerful differ arter this,&rdquo; he said, and
      fell to musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snow, fatigue, and futility destroyed the ardor of the lynching party
      after a time, and they dispersed to their homes. Little was said of this
      expedition afterward, and it became quite impossible to find a man who
      would admit having joined it. For the story went the rounds of the
      mountain that there had been a mistake as to unfair dealing on the part of
      the ranger, and Luke Todd was quite content to accept from the county
      treasury half the sum of the mare's appraisement&mdash;with the deduction
      of the stipulated per cent.&mdash;which Tobe Gryce had paid, the receipt
      for which he produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gossips complained, however, that after all this was settled according
      to law, Tobe wouldn't keep the mare, and insisted that Luke should return
      to him the money he had paid into the treasury, half her value, &ldquo;bein' so
      brigaty he wouldn't own Luke Todd's beast. An' Luke agreed ter so do; but
      he didn't want ter be outdone, so fur the keep o' the filly he gin the
      Cunnel a heifer. An' Tobe war mighty nigh tickled ter death fur the Cunnel
      ter hev a cow o' her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now when December skies darken above Lonesome Cove, and the snow in
      dizzying whirls sifts softly down, and the gaunt brown leafless heights
      are clothed with white as with a garment, and the wind whistles and shouts
      shrilly, and above the great crag loom the distant mountains, and below
      are glimpsed the long stretches of the valley, the two men remember the
      vision that illumined the cavernous solitudes that night, and bless the
      gracious power that sent salvation 'way down to Lonesome Cove, and cherish
      peace and good-will for the sake of a little Child that lay in a manger.
